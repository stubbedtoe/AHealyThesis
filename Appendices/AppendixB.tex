The \textsf{Where4} command-line tool has the following functionality:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Read in the WhyML/Why file and extract feature vectors from its goals.% formulae.
	\item Find the predicted costs for each of the 8 provers by traversing the random forest, using each goal's feature vector.
	\item Sort the costs to produce a ranking of the SMT solvers.
	\item Use the \textsf{Why3} API to call each solver (if it is installed) in rank order.
	%\item Print the result.
	\item Repeat 4 as necessary until a \textit{Valid/Invalid} response is recorded or all installed solvers have been called.
\end{enumerate}
