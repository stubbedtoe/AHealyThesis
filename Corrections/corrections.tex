\section[1]{General comments}

\subsection*{While the work focuses largely on machine learning, this is not reflected well in the overall research hypotheses, which feels both too general and difficult to evaluate (e.g. efficient with respect to what?). The overall hypothesis should be changed to better reflect the machine learning focus.}
 
This has been resolved by re-wording the research hypothesis to the following:  
 
 
\subsection*{The use of a pre-solver makes it hard to judge how much contribution the actual machine learning makes. A discussion on the impact of the pre-solver should be provided.}
	
\subsection*{Further commentary on the selection and extraction of features is needed. Motivation for the approach taken should be clearly outlined and justified. Examples of alternative features that could have been used should be provided and the reasons for exclusion should be described.}
